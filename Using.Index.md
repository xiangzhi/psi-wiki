# Using and Building

Platform for Situated Intelligence is built on the .NET Framework. Large parts of it are built on .NET Standard and therefore run both on Windows and Linux, whereas some components are specific and available only to one operating system (for instance the Kinect sensor component is available only for Windows.)

You can build applications based on Platform for Situated Intelligence either by leveraging nuget packages, or by cloning and building the code. Below are instructions:

* [Using \\psi via Nuget packages](Using.WithNuget.md)
* [Building the \\psi codebase](Using.BuildingPsi.md)
