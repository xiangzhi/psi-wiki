The table below contains the list of available tutorials. If you are new to Platform for Situated Intelligence, we recommend starting with the [Brief Introduction](Brief-Introduction), as it provides an easy introduction to the core \\psi concepts, and then perusing some of the tutorials below.

| Tutorial | Description |
| :------- | :----------------- |
| [Basic Stream Operators](Basic-Stream-Operators) | Provides a brief introduction to basic stream operators available in Platform for Situated Intelligence. |
| [Writing Components](Writing-Components) | Explains how to write new components in the Platform for Situated Intelligence framework. | 
| [Pipeline Execution](Pipeline-Execution) | Explains the basics of running \psi pipelines live, or in replay, and controlling pipeline execution. |
| [Delivery Policies](Delivery-Policies) | Explains the use of _delivery policies_, which are an important \\psi construct that allow the developer to control whether and when the messages flowing over streams get dropped. This allows the developer to configure how an application may keep up with the incoming messages when not enough computational resources are available to process every message. |
| [Stream Fusion and Merging](Stream-Fusion-and-Merging) | Explains the operators for stream fusion, merging, and synchronization. |
| [Interpolation and Sampling](Interpolation-and-Sampling) | Explains the operators for interpolation and sampling. |
| [Windowing Operators](Windowing-Operators) | Explains the operators that allow buffering over streams of data. |
| [Stream Generators](Stream-Generators) | Explains stream generators and timers. |
| [Parallel Operator](Parallel-Operator) | Explains `Parallel`, an operator that enables vector-based parallel computation and dynamic pipelines. |
| [Intervals](Intervals) | Explains the `Interval` data type and how to work with absolute and relative time intervals. |
