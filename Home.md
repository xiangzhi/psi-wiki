# Overview

**Platform for Situated Intelligence** is an open, extensible framework that enables the enables the development, fielding and study of situated, integrative-AI systems. 

In recent years, we have seen significant progress with machine learning techniques on various perceptual and control problems. At the same time, building end-to-end, multimodal, integrative-AI systems that leverage multiple technologies and act autonomously or interact with people in the open world remains a challenging, error-prone and time-consuming engineering task. Numerous challenges stem from the sheer complexity of these systems and are amplified by the lack of appropriate infrastructure and development tools.

The Platform for Situated Intelligence project aims to address these issues and provide a basis for developing, fielding and studying integrative-AI systems. The platform consists of three layers. 

The **Runtime** layer provides a parallel programming model centered around temporal streams of data, and enables easy development of components and applications using .NET, while retaining the performance properties of natively written, carefully tuned systems.

A set of **Tools and APIs** enable multimodal data visualization, processing and analytics. The image below shows Platform for Situated Intelligence studio, i.e., the multimodal data visualization tool.

Finally, an open ecosystem of **Components** encapsulate various AI technologies and allow for quick compositing of integrative-AI applications. 

For more information about the goals of the project, the types of systems that you can build using it, and the various layers see [Platform for Situated Intelligence Overview](PlatformOverview).
