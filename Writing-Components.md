Platform for Situated Intelligence applications are composed by connecting components together. A component in \psi is an encapsulated unit of data processing that, in the most general case, takes a number of streams as input and produces a number of streams as output. Many components are already provided with the framework and in time we expect this eco-system to grow -- the whole idea behind \psi is to enable reuse.

## 1. A Simple \psi Component

### 1.1. Writing the component

To write a new \psi component, we simply define a .NET class, and create a set of _receivers_, which model the inputs and a set of _emitters_ which model the outputs. To illustrate this with an example, consider the component shown in the figure below.

![A simple component](WritingComponents.StringMultiplier.png)

The component has two inputs, the first of type `string`, the second of type `int`, and an output of type `string`. We would like this component to behave as follows: when it receives a message on the `StringIn` input, we would like the component to memorize the input. Then, when it receives a message on the `CountIn` input, we'd like it to push on the output stream a string that contains the received string, copied as many times as specified in the `CountIn` message. Granted, this component is probably not very useful, but it will help us illustrate how components are written and a couple of important points about how they function.

Here is the code for the component:

```csharp
// Implements our new component
public class StringMultiplier
{
    // Variable used to store the last input string
    private string lastStringInput = "";

    // Constructor
    public StringMultiplier(Pipeline pipeline)
    {
        // create the two receivers
        this.StringIn = pipeline.CreateReceiver<string>(this, ReceiveString, nameof(this.StringIn));
        this.CountIn = pipeline.CreateReceiver<int>(this, ReceiveCount, nameof(this.CountIn));

        // create the emitter
        this.Out = pipeline.CreateEmitter<string>(this, nameof(this.Out));
    }

    // Receiver that encapsulates the string input stream
    public Receiver<string> StringIn { get; private set; }

    // Receiver that encapsulates the count input stream
    public Receiver<int> CountIn { get; private set; }

    // Emitter that encapsulates the output stream
    public Emitter<string> Out { get; private set; }

    // The receive method for the StringIn receiver. This executes every time a message arrives on StringIn.
    private void ReceiveString(string input, Envelope envelope)
    {
        this.lastStringInput = input;
    }

    // The receive method for the CountIn receiver. This executes every time a message arrives on CountIn.
    private void ReceiveCount(int count, Envelope envelope)
    {
        // Compose result using a string builder
        var stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            stringBuilder.Append(this.lastStringInput);
        }

        // Post result on the Out emitter, carrying the originating time
        this.Out.Post(stringBuilder.ToString(), envelope.OriginatingTime);
    }
}
```

To define a new component, we simply write a class &mdash; in our case `StringMultiplier`. The constructor takes in the `Pipeline` object, which will be passed to the component at construction time and allows it to create receivers and emitters. The component defines its receivers and emitters (in our case `StringIn` and `CountIn` and `Out`), as properties with public getters and private setters, using the `Receiver<T>` and `Emitter<T>` generic types.

The constructor for the component creates the receivers and emitters by calling the `CreateReceiver` and `CreateEmitter` methods on the pipeline object. In both cases the first parameter is the component itself (i.e. `this`). When creating a receiver, the second parameter specifies a method that will be called when messages arrive at that input. Generally, we refer to these methods as _receiver methods_. In our case, the `StringIn` receiver is associated with the `ReceiveString` method, and the `CountIn` receiver is associated with the `ReceiveCount` method. You can name these methods as you see fit, they simply need to be associated with a particular receiver during the `CreateReceiver` call. Finally, the last parameter in the calls to `CreateReceiver` or `CreateEmitter` is a name that will be associated with that input or output.

The signature for each receiver method has two parameters. The first one is of the same type as the receiver, and will contain at runtime the value of the incoming message on the stream. The second parameter is of type `Envelope` and will contain the message envelope information, including the message originating time, sequence number, etc.

The `ReceiveString` receiver method simply captures the input message in the `lastStringInput` private variable. The `ReceiveCount` receiver creates the corresponding output by using a string builder and appending the stored string as many times as the `count` input. It then posts the results on the output stream by calling the `Post` method on the `this.Out` emitter. The `Post` call takes two parameters: the first is the message to be posted, which needs to be of the same type as the emitter. The second parameter is the originating time for this message. As explained in the [Brief Introduction](Brief-Introduction) tutorial and the [Synchronization](Synchronization) in-depth topic, \psi components propagate the originating times for the incoming messages to the output streams. It is the responsibility of the component author to make sure this is the case and to choose what the originating time for each outgoing message is. In this case, we are choosing to propagate the originating time from the count input as this is what triggers the outputs.

### 1.2. Using the component

To use this component, we have to instantiate it and connect it into the larger application graph. Here is one example:

```csharp
using (var p = Pipeline.Create())
{
    var strings = Generators.Return(p, "Test");
    var counts = Generators.Range(p, 1, 5);

    var stringMultiplierComponent = new StringMultiplier(p);
    strings.PipeTo(stringMultiplierComponent.StringIn);
    counts.PipeTo(stringMultiplierComponent.CountIn);

    stringMultiplierComponent.Out.Do(m => Console.WriteLine(m));

    p.Run();
}
```

Here we generate a stream of strings that posts a single message "Test" via `Generators.Return`, and a stream that posts the integers from 1 to 5 via `Generators.Range`. After initializing the component, we connect the input streams to the component receivers using the `PipeTo` operator. Finally, we process the component output with a `Do` operator that simply prints the results to the console.

Next, we would like to discuss a couple of important aspects about the \psi programming model that are fundamental to how components run and are implicit in the example above.

### 1.3. Exclusivity of receivers

Components connected in a \psi pipeline generally execute concurrently. The \psi runtime controls their execution, by controlling when the receiver methods are called with the next available message.

In this process, _the runtime guarantees exclusivity between the execution of different receiver methods_ on the same component. In other words, if one of the receiver methods is launched, it will be guaranteed to complete before any other receiver method on the same component is invoked. This is an important property, as it generally allows the component developer to write components without concerns about thread safety. For instance, in the `StringMultiplier` component above, both receivers access the same `lastStringInput` class member. However, no synchronization primitives are used to ensure exclusivity. The runtime guarantees that whenever the `ReceiveCount` method is executing, the `ReceiveString` method is not executing and the other way around. This way, the component state variables (like `lastStringInput` in our example) are automatically protected. At the same time, when the application is executed the \psi runtime can still schedule multiple components to run in parallel and achieve pipeline-level parallelism and CPU efficiencies, while maintaining this helpful invariant.

There are two additional observations we would like to make in relationship to the exclusivity of receivers. First, the runtime is able to know where to ensure exclusivity, because of the first parameter on the `CreateReceiver` method. Recall in the example above the lines used to create the two emitters:

```csharp
// create the two receivers
this.StringIn = pipeline.CreateReceiver<string>(this, ReceiveString, nameof(this.StringIn));
this.CountIn = pipeline.CreateReceiver<int>(this, ReceiveCount, nameof(this.CountIn));
```

The first parameter of the `CreateReceiver` method (called `owner`) is an object that informs the runtime that these receivers are owned by the same component. In this case, since we have passed in `this`, i.e. the reference to the current instance of the component, the runtime will know to execute these methods exclusively on that component instance. If a second component of the same type would be instantiated and connected somewhere in the same pipeline, the receiver exclusivity applies on each of the components separately, but the two components can execute in parallel.

The second observation is more of a programming guideline. Because of exclusivity of receivers, care in general should be taken that the processing code running in each receiver does not take too long, as this would induce large latencies in the pipeline and would also prevent other receivers from being scheduled during that time. The \psi parallel programming model in effect encourages decomposition and encapsulation, and discourages large, monolithic components. Later on, in the [Composite-components](#CompositeComponents) section of this document, we discuss how to instead construct large components by hierarchically aggregating smaller ones. This not only will foster encapsulation and reuse, but will also enable gains in efficiency via the pipeline-parallel execution afforded by the runtime scheduler.

### 1.4. Isolated execution and message ownership

The \psi runtime uses an automatic cloning system when passing messages around to enable data-isolation between components. Component writers can _access_, _read_ and even _modify_ the messages arriving inside a receiver method (like in a regular .NET event handler) without worrying about concurrency with other components that may also receive and operate simultaneously on the same message (multiple downstream components can be connected to the same source stream). Each receiver method connected to an emitter gets its own copy of the data that can be read and modified at will throughout the lifetime of that receiver method.

At the same time, once the receiver method exits, the runtime may choose to reuse the memory underneath the message (the cloning mechanism reuses message buffers, in an effort to minimize the number of allocations and garbage collections that happen when the pipeline runs in steady-state). As a result, if the component needs to hold on to a message past the exit from the receiver, the message should be cloned. The \psi runtime provides a general method for cloning .NET objects called `DeepClone()`.

__Note__: In the example above, in the `ReceiveString` receiver method, it would seem that we would need to do the assignment by using `DeepClone()`, i.e. `this.lastStringInput = input.DeepClone();`. The reason this is not necessary is because strings in C# are immutable and the simple assignment operator creates a new string object. In general though, for reference types, `DeepClone` would need to be used to retain the value past the lifetime of the receiver method.

Finally, with respect to output streams, it is important to note that a component can post a value to the output stream (via a `Post` call) and is free to immediately change the value. All the receivers that are connected to this emitter will receive the value that was provided during the call to `Post`. This is again accomplished by the runtime via automated cloning.

The [Shared Objects](Shared-Objects) in-depth topic contains more information about message cloning.

<a name="StreamOperators"></a>

## 2. Stream Operators

We have so far discussed how to write a general \psi component, i.e. one with any number of input and output streams. We have also discussed how components are scheduled for execution by the runtime and how data is passed to them. We now turn attention to _stream operators_, or _consumer-producer_ components, which are a particular case of the more general component presented above. Specifically, they are components that have a single input and a single output.

Since writing single-input / single-output components that process a stream is a common task, the \psi framework provides a base class, i.e. `ConsumerProducer<TIn, TOut>` that can be used to simplify the construction of these components. Below is an example consumer-producer component that computes the sign (+1 or -1) of a stream of doubles.

```csharp
// The class defines a consumer-producer component
public class Sign : ConsumerProducer<double, int>
{
    // Constructor
    public Sign(Pipeline p)
        : base(p) { }

    // Override receiver method
    protected override void Receive(double data, Envelope envelope)
    {
        this.Out.Post(Math.Sign(data), envelope.OriginatingTime);
    }
}
```

The constructor for the base class `ConsumerProducer` builds the receiver `In` of type `double` and the emitter `Out` of type `int` and provide a virtual receiver method which the developer can override. In the receiver method, we compute and post the result to the `Out` emitter.

We have seen in the previous section that components can be used in an application by instantiating them and connecting them to other streams via the `PipeTo` operator. In the case of simple consumer-producer components, a simple design pattern enables the construction of stream operators and simplifies usage in the application. The pattern involves creating an extension method for the streams of type double that wraps the component creation and connection steps, like below:

```csharp
// static class for defining stream operator extension methods
public static class Operators
{
    // static stream operator method
    public static IProducer<int> Sign(this IProducer<double> source, DeliveryPolicy<double> deliveryPolicy = null)
    {
        // create the component
        var signComponent = new Sign(source.Out.Pipeline);
        // pipe the source stream to it
        source.PipeTo(signComponent, deliveryPolicy);
        // return the output
        return signComponent.Out;
    }
}
```

The extension methods extends `IProducer<double>`, which represents a stream of `double`. Inside, it instantiates a new component (note that we can get a hold of the pipeline required to construct the component from the source stream), and connects the source stream to it, and returns the result. Notice how the stream operator also takes a `deliveryPolicy` parameter, with a default `null` value and uses it when connecting the source stream to the underlying component. This `deliveryPolicy` enables developers to control how messages are delivered to the component when computational constraints prevent the component from being able to process all messages at the rate at which they arrive. The [Delivery Policies](Delivery-Policies) tutorial contains more information about how delivery policies operate. 

The constructed _stream operator_ `Sign()` now becomes available on any stream of doubles, for instance, we can now write:

```csharp
var stream = Generators.Sequence(p, 1.0, x => x + 1, 10);
stream.Sign().Do(s => Console.WriteLine($"Sign: {s}"));
```

The [Basic Stream Operators](Basic-Stream-Operators) in the \psi runtime, like `Select`, `Do`, `Where`, etc., are implemented using this pattern.

A final note regarding a few interfaces that are available, `IConsumerProducer<TIn, TOut>`, `IConsumer<TIn>` and `IProducer<TOut>`. If you take a look at the `ConsumerProducer` class (under `Sources\Runtime\Microsoft.Psi\Components\ConsumerProducer.cs`), you will notice that it implements the `IConsumerProducer<TIn, TOut>` interface, which is an aggregate of the `IConsumer<TIn>` and `IProducer<TOut>` interfaces. These interfaces merely specify that a class has an `In` receiver, and/or an `Out` emitter. They are used largely for creating syntactic convenience. Specifically, they enable the `PipeTo` operator to take as an argument the component class directly, rather than the corresponding receiver. For instance, in the example above, we were able to say directly

```csharp
source.PipeTo(signComponent, deliveryPolicy);
```

instead of

```csharp
source.PipeTo(signComponent.In, deliveryPolicy)
```

because the `Sign` component implements `IConsumer` and `PipeTo` knows how to route to an `IConsumer`. By deriving from `ConsumerProducer<TIn, TOut>` your component class automatically implements this interface.

<a name="Subpipelines"></a>

## 3. Subpipelines

Subpipelines are a construct that enable hierarchical organization in the computation graph. They enable developing composite components, or dynamic computation graphs that can have a lifetime separate from their parent `Pipeline`.

The `Subpipeline` class is essentially a `Pipeline` (it derives from it), but is also a component that can be added to a parent pipeline. This allows for a means of abstraction and for hierarchically organizing computation graphs via [composite components](#CompositeComponents), which we describe in more detail in the next section. Additionally, subpipelines may have a lifetime that is independent of that of their parent. Finally, subpipelines enable initializing and starting or stopping child components independently from the parent to which they belong, and hence dynamically constructing computation graphs. As an example, subpipelines are used internally by the [`Parallel` operator](Parallel-Operator) to dynamically create and run parallel computation graphs for multiple instances, while respecting source component initialization, start and stop events, etc.

Because they may include source components, subpipelines implement the [`ISourceComponent` interface](#SourceComponents) and complete when all of their child source components have completed. If a `Subpipeline` contains _no_ source components then it completes (calls `notifyCompletionTime`) at startup, and therefore behaves as a purely reactive component.

Subpipelines have their own `Scheduler`, and unless otherwise specified, adopt a `DeliveryPolicy.Unlimited` [default delivery policy](Delivery-Policies). 

If not explicitly started via `Run()` or `RunAsync()`, subpipelines start when the parent pipeline starts - just as a normal component. They may also be created and started dynamically at runtime. 

Constructing a subpipeline and attaching components to it is simple:

```csharp
using (var p = Pipeline.Create("root"))
{
    using (var s = Subpipeline.Create(p, "sub"))
    {
        // add to sub-pipeline
        var seq = Generators.Sequence(s, new[] { 1, 2, 3 });
        p.Run(); // run parent pipeline
    }
}
```

<a name="CompositeComponents"></a>

## 4. Composite-components

_Composite-components_ allow for aggregating a graph of existing components in a single, higher-level component. As an example, consider the figure below. The composite-component depicted here wraps the previous `StringMultiplier` component, together with a stream operator component that computes the absolute value of the input stream into a single composite-component with two inputs and two outputs. The inputs correspond like before to a string and count. On the output side, will provide the multiplied string and absolute value of the count. Like in the previous example, this composite-component is not very useful, but will help illustrate how composite-components are created.

![A composite-component](WritingComponents.CompositeComponent.png)

The code for this composite-component is shown below:

```csharp
// Implements a simple composite-component
public class CompositeComponent : Subpipeline
{
    // Connector for the string input
    private Connector<string> stringIn;

    // Connector for the count input
    private Connector<int> countIn;

    // Constructor
    public CompositeComponent(Pipeline pipeline)
        : base(pipeline, nameof(CompositeComponent))
    {
        // Create the connectors
        this.stringIn = this.CreateInputConnectorFrom<string>(pipeline, nameof(this.StringIn));
        this.countIn = this.CreateInputConnectorFrom<int>(pipeline, nameof(this.CountIn));

        // Define the outputs
        var stringOut = this.CreateOutputConnectorTo<string>(pipeline, nameof(this.StringOut));
        var absCountOut = this.CreateOutputConnectorTo<int>(pipeline, nameof(this.AbsCountOut));
        this.StringOut = stringOut.Out;
        this.AbsCountOut = absCountOut.Out;

        // Create the string multiplier component, and connect it
        var stringMultiplierComponent = new StringMultiplier(this);
        this.stringIn.Out.PipeTo(stringMultiplierComponent.StringIn);
        stringMultiplierComponent.Out.PipeTo(stringOut);

        // Create the absolute value of count stream by applying a Select operator
        var abs = this.countIn.Out.Select(v => v > 0 ? v : -v);
        abs.PipeTo(stringMultiplierComponent.CountIn);
        abs.Out.PipeTo(absCountOut);
    }

    // Receiver for string input
    public Receiver<string> StringIn => this.stringIn.In;

    // Receiver for count input
    public Receiver<int> CountIn => this.countIn.In;

    // Emitter for string output
    public Emitter<string> StringOut { get; private set; }

    // Emitter for absolute count output
    public Emitter<int> AbsCountOut { get; private set; }
}
```

Like with a regular component, a composite-component is written as a class. A recommended approach is to inherit from `Subpipeline`; providing a clear delineation in the graph (future tools may collapse graph visualization, for example). The constructor also receives the pipeline object, and sets up the receivers and emitters. The difference is in that there are no receiver methods. Instead, receivers for composite-components can be setup with the help of connectors, implemented by the  `Connector<T>` class. A _connector_ exposes a member `In` that acts as a receiver, and a member `Out` that acts as an emitter. This way, it can live on the input boundary of the composite-component and be seen as a receiver from outside the component and as an emitter from inside. The constructor code can then create a number of sub-components and wire them together to the connector outputs. Also notice that internal components are given the subpipeline as their host upon construction (e.g. `new StringMultiplier(this)`). This ensures that the inner components remain isolated from the parent pipeline while also not exposing subpipeline emitters to the outside world. Example:

```csharp
this.stringIn.Out.PipeTo(stringMultiplierComponent.StringIn);
```

On the output side, the composite-component emitters can be assigned directly from the sub-component emitter or existing wiring &mdash; see the last couple of lines in the constructor above.

<a name="PipelineStartStop"></a>

## 5. Pipeline Events

Applications or components may need to do setup and teardown work just before the pipeline runs and/or after it completes. For this, the `Pipeline` provides events which may be subscribed to and handled as appropriate:

```csharp
// Event that is raised when the pipeline starts running.
event EventHandler<PipelineRunEventArgs> PipelineRun;

// Event that is raised upon pipeline completion.
event EventHandler<PipelineCompletedEventArgs> PipelineCompleted;
```

The `PipelineRun` event is raised when the pipeline starts running, but before any messages begin to flow. The `PipelineCompleted` is raised upon pipeline completion, when all components have been stopped and messages are no longer being produced. As the pipeline is not in a running state, no messages should be posted in the handlers for either of these events.

<a name="SourceComponents"></a>

## 6. Source Component Interface

In contrast to _reactive components_, which are those that produce output _only_ in response to incoming message, _source components_ are the "headwaters" of the system; the source from which messages flow. These are components that originate streams of data. Typically these components encapsulate sensors, such as cameras, microphones, accelerometers, etc., but may also represent hybrid components which both react to, as well as produce, streams of data.

Source components must be declared as such for the pipeline to behave correctly. The `ISourceComponent` interface serves this purpose.

### 6.1. Completion

Some source components have a notion of "completion". These represent finite streams of data. These are commonly "importers" of some kind; producing messages from a data source. The data is finite and so is the source component. The `Start(Action<DateTime> notifyCompletionTime)` method provides a means for the component to later notify the pipeline of completion by way of a `notifyCompletionTime` action to call once no more messages are forthcoming and indicating the originating time of the final message (or else `pipeline.GetCurrentTime()`). Source components that are truly infinite and do not have a notion of completion (e.g. an always-on camera or other sensor component) should invoke the `notifyCompletionTime` action with a time of `DateTime.MaxValue`. 

```csharp
// Implementors should advise the pipeline when they are done posting as well as
// the originating time of completion; on or after the final message originating time
void ISourceComponent.Start(Action<DateTime> notifyCompletionTime);
```

`Start(...)` is called during pipeline startup, after the graph of components has been constructed. Once a source component's `Start()` method has been called, it may begin posting messages at any point thereafter. Component receivers need to handle the possibilty of receiving and reacting to messages during startup.

Once all source components have completed, downstream reactive components no longer have anything to which to react and the pipeline is free to shut down. Any cycles in the graph where reactive components are "down stream" from themselves do not prevent pipeline shut down.

```csharp
// Called by the pipeline when shutting down.
void ISourceComponent.Stop(DateTime finalOriginatingTime, Action notifyCompleted);
```

`Stop(...)` is called to notify the source component that the pipeline is shutting down. The `finalOriginatingTime` indicates the pipeline time after which no messages bearing a later originating time will be delivered. However, if a source component expects to produce but has yet to post messages with originating times before `finalOriginatingTime`, then it should continue to generate and post such messages. As soon as it has done so, or as soon as it can guarantee that it will never post any more messages with an originating time less than or equal to `finalOriginatingTime`, it should invoke the `notifyCompleted` action to inform the pipeline that it has completed generating source messages. However, if the component does have inputs, it is expected to continue to handle incoming messages, which may include posting messages from inside its receivers.

### 6.2. Infinite Sources

Some source components are "infinite sources". They produce _perpetual_ streams of data which do not have a notion of completion, such as an "always-on" sensor. Such components should implement `ISourceComponent` and call `notifyCompletionTime(DateTime.MaxValue)` in their `Start(Action<DateTime> notifyCompletionTime)` method. The `DateTime.MaxValue` as the final originating time tells the runtime to expect an infinite stream from the component.

### 6.3. Generator Pattern

In the discussion above, we have assumed that the source component obtains data via a thread that it starts or obtains, but that cannot be controlled by the runtime scheduler. However, this also means that the runtime cannot throttle these components, i.e. it cannot slow down the production of the source messages if it needs to (for instance if resource constraints prevent the full pipeline to run at the speed of the source).

To permit this type of dynamic slow down of data sources, the runtime offers a _generator pattern_ that enables writing source components that can by under the control of the scheduler. A base, abstract component class called `Generator` is provided. The example below, which can be found in the `Test.Psi` project under `Sources\Runtime\Test.Psi\GeneratorSample.cs` illustrates how to write such a generator class that reads in a text file with two columns and outputs two streams, each containing the data corresponding to each column.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Microsoft.Psi;
using Microsoft.Psi.Components;

// This example loads a text file and outputs each line
// a line is expected to contain a timestamp and a value, which can be either an int or a string
// e.g.:
// 1000, 10
// 2000, this is  a test
// 3000, of multi-stream generator
// 4000, 11
public class GeneratorSample : Generator
{
    private TextReader reader;

    public GeneratorSample(Pipeline p, string fileName)
        : base(p)
    {
        this.OutInt = p.CreateEmitter<int>(this, nameof(this.OutInt));
        this.OutString = p.CreateEmitter<string>(this, nameof(this.OutString));
        this.reader = File.OpenText(fileName);
    }

    public Emitter<int> OutInt { get; }

    public Emitter<string> OutString { get; }

    // read the file line by line,
    // and post either an int value or a string value to the appropriate output stream
    protected override DateTime GenerateNext(DateTime previous)
    {
        string line = this.reader.ReadLine();
        if (line == null)
        {
            return DateTime.MaxValue; // no more data
        }

        // first value in each line is the timestamp (ticks),
        // second is either an int or a string, separated by ','
        var parts = line.Split(new[] { ',' }, 2);

        // parse the originating time.
        // If the data doesn't come with a timestamp, pipeline.GetCurrentTime() can be used instead
        var originatingTime = DateTime.Parse(parts[0].Trim());
        if (int.TryParse(parts[1].Trim(), out int intValue))
        {
            this.OutInt.Post(intValue, originatingTime);
        }
        else
        {
            this.OutString.Post(parts[1], originatingTime);
        }

        return originatingTime;
    }
}
```

The component must override the virtual `GenerateNext` method to produce data on the output streams (in this case `OutInt` and `OutString`. This method will be called to produce data when the runtime decides the pipeline is ready to consume it. The method must return the originating time of the last message it posted. Internally, the base `Generator` class has a loopback mechanism where a message with the originating time equal to the return value of the `GenerateNext` method is posted back to a (hidden) input of the component. The `GenerateNext` method is called from the receiver method for this loop-back input (for details, see `Sources\Runtime\Microsoft.Psi\Components\Generator.cs`. This way, because this loop-back message is being scheduled like any other message in the pipeline, the runtime can control when the next data is generated. The pace at which data is produced is in this case under the scheduler control.

## 7. Guidelines for Writing Components

In general, follow the guidelines we have already provided above when writing components.

If you are writing a single-input, single-output component, use the `ConsumerProducer<TIn, TOut>` base class and write a corresponding stream operator as an extension method as this will simplify authoring. Make sure the stream operator takes a `DeliveryPolicy<TIn>` parameter, and uses it when creating the connection to the receiver of the consumer-producer class.

If your component has a single input, but multiple outputs, name the input `In` and implement the `IConsumer<T>` interface. Similarly, if your component has multiple inputs but a single output, name the output `Out` and implement the `IProducer<T>` interface.

If your component posts messages from outside its receiver(s) that are not generated in response to messages received (e.g. from its own threads or event handlers), then it is a source component and should implement the `ISourceComponent` interface. Such messages must not be posted before the interface's `Start` method is called or after the `Stop` method returns. However, purely reactive messages (i.e. those that are produced in response to a received message) may continue to be posted from within a receiver method.

If your component has multiple inputs and multiple outputs, we recommend you name the inputs using a pattern FooIn, e.g. AudioIn, ImageIn, etc. and the outputs using the pattern FooOut, e.g. AudioOut, ImageOut, etc. This way, developers can use the auto-completion features in Intellisense to quickly discover the inputs and outputs a component might have by just typing "In" or "Out" after component and ".".

If your component uses unmanaged resources, also implement `IDisposable`. The \psi runtime will call the `Dispose()` method on all components when the pipeline shuts down, allowing the to free unmanaged resources.
