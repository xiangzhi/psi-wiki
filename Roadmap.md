This is an initial, beta version of Platform for Situated Intelligence. The current version includes the Platform for Situated Intelligence runtime, visualization tools, and an initial set of components (mostly geared towards audio and visual processing).

The codebase is currently in beta and various aspects of the platform are at different levels of completion and robustness, and we will still likely be making some breaking API changes. 

Moving forward, we plan to prioritize addressing the bugs and issues that are discovered. The roadmap below describes some of the areas we plan to focus our efforts on moving forward:

### Runtime

- generalizing data importers and exporters to other storage types besides \\psi stores;
- evolving the documentation with additional topics, including adding more samples and walkthroughs;

### Visualization and Platform for Situated Intelligence Studio 

- enabling data annotation scenarios in PsiStudio;
- ability to work with other data sources besides \\psi stores;
- refining existing visualizers;
- evolving and documenting the support for third-party visualizers and batch task processing in PsiStudio;

### Data processing and Machine Learning

- evolving and better documenting data-processing APIs;
- providing infrastructure and APIs for supporting the machine-learning development loop; 

### Interaction Toolkit

- providing a toolkit (set of components) that enable rapid development of physically situated interactive systems;
