## GitHub Issues

If you find a reproducible bug or if you would like to request a new feature or additional documentation, please file an [issue on the github repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/psi/issues). If you do so, please check first that a corresponding issue has not already been filed. Use the [`bug`](https://github.com/Microsoft/psi/labels/bug) label when filing issues that represent code defects, and provide enough information to reproduce. Use the [`feature request`](https://github.com/Microsoft/psi/labels/feature%20request) label to request new features, and use the [`documentation`](https://github.com/Microsoft/psi/labels/documentation) label to request additional documentation. 

## Gitter

In addition, the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/psi) is a good place to solicit help from the broader community of Platform for Situated Intelligence, and to provide help to others.
