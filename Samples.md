The [psi-samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/psi-samples) repository contains a few small example applications written with Platform for Situated Intelligence. Some of the samples address specialized topics like how to leverage speech recognition components or how to bridge to ROS, but in general looking through them can give you more insight into programming with Platform for Situated Intelligence. Besides these samples, a good place to start reading about programming with \\psi is the [Brief Introduction](Brief-Introduction) and the set of [Tutorials](Tutorials). 

As indicated in the last column in the table below, some of the samples have a corresponding detailed **walkthrough** that explains how the samples are constructed and function, and provide further pointers to documentation and learning materials. Going through these walkthroughs can also help you learn more about programming with \\psi.
